### How to Contribute/Making PRs
- Fork the repo. 
- Clone the repo.     
    - Either download the zip source code, or copy the URL, create a new folder     
  ```git init``` and ```git clone https://github.com/<username>/ACM-PEC-Website```
  <br/> 
- This will give you access to all branches of the origin through remote. You need to now fetch all branches    
```git fetch```    

- ```git checkout master``` and create a copy of this branch ```git checkout -b <new-branch>```    
If at some point you watch pull files from some other branch: ```git pull origin <that-branch>```

- You can make your changes in this branch and if you are using VS Code Version Control it will show you beautifully all the changes made.

- Last step is to make changes visible on cloud    
```git add .``` -> ```git commit -m "relevant_msg"``` -> ```git push origin master```    

- You can come to your forked repo and create the PR.
